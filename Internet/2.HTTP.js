//HTTP(Hypertext Transfer Protocol)

// why HTTP:

1. HTTP is used to communicate two computers
2. To communicate to the computers, they needs some rules to communicate which is known as 'Protocol'
3. At the heart of HTTP is a simple request-response system. The "requesting" computer, also known as the "client", asks another computer for some information. That computer, "the server" sends back a response with the information that was requested.
4. HTTP powers websites
5. URL(Unified Resource Locator) is essentially an address of another computer or server on the internet. Part of the URL specifies how to reach the server and part of it tell the server what information we want.
6. Using URL with HTTP:
    a. The http:// at the beginning of the website URL specifies that http protocol will be used for communication.
    b. Other communication protocols use URLs as well, (hence "Uniform Resource Locator"). That's why, we need to be specific when we're making HTTP requests by prefixing the URL with http://
7. Request and Response:
    1. A "client" is a computer making an HTTP request.
    2. A "server" is a computer responding to an HTTP request.
    3. A computer can be a client, a server, both, or neither. "Client" and "server" are just words we use to describe what computers are doing within a communication system.
    5. Clients send requests and receive responses.
    6. Servers receive requests and send responses.
8. Clients and servers in the context of HTTP
    a. Clients:
        1. Client is exist in frontend
        2. Clients send requests and receive responses.
    b. Server:
        1. Server is exist in backend
        2. Servers receive requests and send responses.


// DNS(Domain Name System):
1. Web Addresses:
    a. DOMAIN NAMES AND IP ADDRESSES:
        1. Each device connected to the internet has a unique IP address. When we browse the internet, the domains we navigate to are all associated with a particular IP address!
        2. For example, this Wikipedia URL points to a page about miniature pigs: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miniature_pig
        3. The domain portion of the URL is en.wikipedia.org.
        4. en.wikipedia.org converts to a specific IP address, and that IP address tells your computer exactly where to communicate with that Wikipedia page.
